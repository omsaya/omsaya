Things to take away

1.Every valid Java Application must have a class definition (that matches the filename).
2.The main method must be inside the class definition.
3.The compiler executes the codes starting from the main function.

This is a valid Java program that does nothing.

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
    }
}
